# Bridge-Scoring
Pure javascript app to score contract bridge, designed to run on old or obsolete equipment

This application was designed for use in senior centers in Maryland, USA. In those locations, 
1) Many of the players are not familiar with computers
2) The equipment that is available is often old, obsolete, or under powered
3) In many cases, the users are not able to install supporting libraries (e.g., JQuery) on the available equipment
