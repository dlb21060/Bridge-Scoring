<h1>Scoring Format for Manual Entry</h1>
<br/>
Scores may be entered manually, instead of using the drop-down menu options.

<h2>The format for scoring is:</h2>
<span class="helpSample">LEVEL DENOMINATION [optional double] PLAYER RESULT<br/>
  -- OR --<br/>
PASS</span><br/><br/>
LEVEL is designated by 1,2,...7<br/>
DESIGNATION is one of C, D, H, S, or N<br/> 
DOUBLE may be blank, X (for a doubled contract) or XX (for a redoubled contract)<br/>
PLAYER is N, E, S, or W<br/>
RESULT is = for contracts made without overtricks, +{1-6} for contracts making overtricks, or -{1-13} for contracts going down<br/>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<dl class="helpExamples">
<dt class="whatHappened">The hand is passed out</dt>
<dd class="notation">PASS</dd>
<br/>
<dt class="whatHappened">4 Hearts by South, making exactly</dt>
<dd class="notation">4HS=</dd>
<br/>
<dt class="whatHappened">4 Spades by North, doubled, down one</dt>
<dd class="notation">4SxN-1</dd>
<br/>

<dt class="whatHappened">1 No Trump by East, redoubled, making with one overtrick</dt>
<dd class="notation">1NxxE+1</dd>
<br/>

<dt class="whatHappened">3 No Trump by West, making</dt>
<dd class="notation">3 N W =</dd>
<br/>
</dl>

<span class="whatHappened">Note that spaces between elements of the score are optional, and case is irrelevant. <br/>Thus,</span> 
<span class="notation">4SxN-1</span> <span class="whatHappened">is equivalent to: </span> <span class="notation">4 s X n -1</span>
